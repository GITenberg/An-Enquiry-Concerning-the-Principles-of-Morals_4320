description: "An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (EPM) is a book by Scottish\
  \ enlightenment philosopher David Hume. In it, Hume argues (among other things)\
  \ that the foundations of morals lie with sentiment, not reason.\nAn Enquiry Concerning\
  \ the Principles of Morals is the enquiry subsequent to the Enquiry Concerning Human\
  \ Understanding (EHU). Thus, it is often referred to as \"the second Enquiry\".\
  \ It was originally published in 1751, three years after the first Enquiry. Hume\
  \ first discusses ethics in A Treatise of Human Nature (in Book 3 - \"Of Morals\"\
  ). He later extracted and expounded upon the ideas he proposed there in his second\
  \ Enquiry. In his short autobiographical work, My Own Life (1776), Hume states that\
  \ his second Enquiry is \"of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary,\
  \ incomparably the best.\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
